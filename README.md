# Learning-Management-App-Backend
Leaning Management App is a tool to help you manage your studies for example when we come across a nice article and we are busy, most of the time we either bookmark or save it on read it later apps, but the problem is we forget to read all of them and we end up deleting some or most of them. LMA is here to solve that issue and also to bring other benefits some includes:-  - Save or Schedule an article to read later - Get notified when it's time to read an article.  - Manage when and how you want to read your articles by postponing or rescheduling them.  -See your learning schedules on your learning calendar. LMA is your personal reading time table where you can save and see your learning schedules.
